<h1>About Aiden Blancher</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Aiden Blancher and I will be telling you about myself.</p>
<p>Starting off I'm from Morrisburg, Ontario. I was born on March  19<sup>th</sup> 2005. I am a sports fan. I went to a hight school called Seaway District High school I like many sports such as Tennis and Badminton. My favourite sport is Soccer. I play soccer on Saturdays in a friendly league. I like to spend time with my family on the weekends. I come back home on the weekend because I feel lonely at college. Also I like playing video games. Some games I like to play include Rocket league, and Fifa. I like to watch movies. My favourite movies are from the Star wars series. I am a massive Star wars nerd. I like to follow how this quote by qui-gon jinn, “Don’t center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.” “Always remember, your focus determines your reality.”. I like to look more into details and history of the lore. My favourite part of star wars was the clone wars. My favourite movie is Rogue one.</p>
<p>I have been to many places. I have been all over canada including Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. I also have been to the Usa a lot. Quite a few time I have been to Florida. I have been to Disney world 10 times and Lego world 3 times. I like to travel a lot. I dream of one day traveling the world. I would like to see <strong>England</strong> or <strong>Germany</strong>.</p>
<p>This was all about me. Thank you for listening to me.</p>
